From Hemant Uike to Everyone:  10:34 AM
Items has lifespan beyond function so we can read it but can’t modify it. Right ??
From Prashanth Puranik to Everyone:  10:36 AM
No we can modify it inside the addToCart / showCart
these 2 object methods have complete access. No other part of the code is able to access items though

From Prashanth Puranik to Everyone:  10:51 AM
You can paste your code snippet here
From Aniruddha Chakravarty to Everyone:  10:51 AM
function getRndInteger(min, max) {
  return Math.random(min, max);
}
From Rahul Kumar to Everyone:  10:53 AM
return Math.floor(Math.random() * (200 - 100 + 1)) + 100;
From Prashanth Puranik to Everyone:  10:55 AM
Yes, this works I guess :)
You can use min and max in place of 100 and 200
From Rahul to Everyone:  10:55 AM
Math.floor((max-min) * Math.random()) + min
From Harsh Kandhway to Everyone:  10:56 AM
function randomInRange(min, max)
{
	return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min) + min);
}
From Prashanth Puranik to Everyone:  10:56 AM
Thanks Rahul, Harsh
From Ganesh Mastud to Everyone:  11:00 AM
return parseInt(Math.random(100,200)*200); this is also right
From Aniruddha Chakravarty to Everyone:  11:02 AM
ParseInt ensures an integer value is reached?
Noted.

please raise your hand when you complete
From Rahul to Everyone:  12:30 PM
let numbers =[5,11,13,7,2,31,3,19,23,17,29];

numbers.sort(function(x,y){
    return x-y;
})
console.log(numbers);
numbers.sort(function(x,y){
    return y-x;
})

console.log(numbers);

numbers.push(37)

console.log(numbers);

numbers.splice(-2, 2);
console.log(numbers);

numbers.splice(3, 2, 'seven', 'Eleven')
// numbers[3] = 'Seven'
// numbers[4] = 'Eleven'
console.log(numbers)

console.log(numbers.indexOf(23));
console.log(numbers.indexOf(41));
From Prashanth Puranik to Everyone:  12:32 PM
Thanks Rahul
Seems good
From Aniruddha Chakravarty to Everyone:  12:35 PM
var numbers = [5, 11, 13, 7, 2, 31, 3, 19, 23, 17, 29]; 

//sort in increasing array 

numbers.sort(function( x, y ) {

    return x-y;

});



console.log( numbers );


console.log("----------------------------------");

//sort in decreasing array 

numbers.sort(function( x, y ) {

    return y-x;

});


console.log( numbers );

console.log("---------------------------------");


//push number 37 into sorted array: 

numbers.push(37);

console.log(numbers);

console.log("---------------------------------");

//pop last 2 numbers from sorted array: 

numbers.pop(); 
numbers.pop(); 

console.log(numbers);

console.log("---------------------------------");

//splice indices  3 and 4 and put "Seven" and "Eleven": 


numbers.splice(3, 2, "Seven", "Eleven");
console.log(numbers);

//indexOf(23) / indexOf(41): 



console.log(numbers.indexOf(23));

console.log(numbers.indexOf(41));
